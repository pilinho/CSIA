</table>
<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Pre-heat the oven to 170°/150°C Fan/Gas Mark 3.
Place the butter and caster sugar into a mixing bowl and beat well for 1-2 minutes using an electric mixer, until the mixture is light and pale.
Add the remaining sponge ingredients and mix for a further 2 minutes.
Place into two round 20cm cake tins that have been greased and base-lined with baking parchment
Bake in the pre-heated oven for 30 minutes, or until the cakes spring back when lightly touched.
Leave in the tins until the sponge has cooled before turning out onto a cooling rack.
</p>
<p><strong>To make the buttercream and decorate:</strong>

Beat together the butter, icing sugar, vanilla extract and milk until soft. Place 2 generous tablespoons of mixture in one bowl and 4 into another (the smaller amount for the cake topping and the rest for the cake filling).
Crumble 4 Chocolate O’s into the buttercream to make the filling. Spread evenly between the sponge layers.
Melt the chocolate in a small bowl over a pan of hot water or carefully melt in a microwave. </p>
